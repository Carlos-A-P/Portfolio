It was a lot more than I expected but overall a very educational experience. I learned that there are many ways to do things, but some may be much easier and efficient than others. For example, my accordion was comprised of many buttons, but I first started by using div elements along with click event listeners. I later discovered that it was very tedious to make it accessible and decided to go with buttons instead, which comprised its own challenges with inner tags. Overall, I wanted to make an app that was mainly functional and accessible, so I didn't focus too much on transitions. I enjoyed this project, and I certainly learned a lot from it."

I tried to connect this to a backend server such as Azure db but I found it rather difficult and resulted to using local storage which also got the results that I wanted. I thought it was a lot easier to use for loops for this but quickly learned that in order to use them I have to keep changing the original array. As for saving the user's list, I saved the inner html of the todo wrapper and store it in a local storage every time it gets updated but some of the event handlers. Something that I'd like to improve on it learning how to implement a functional drag and drop without having to use an open source code."

I generally reserve the class attribute for my css and my id attributes for JavaScript, however, in this case I had multiple buttons so I used the data attribute. As far as what I learned in CSS, I learned how to used the focus pseudo-class to let the user see the tip percentage they are using."
