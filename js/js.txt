It was a lot more than I expected but overall a very educational experience. I learned that there are many ways to do things, but some may be much easier and efficient than others. For example, my accordion was comprised of many buttons, but I first started by using div elements along with click event listeners. I later discovered that it was very tedious to make it accessible and decided to go with buttons instead, which comprised its own challenges with inner tags. Overall, I wanted to make an app that was mainly functional and accessible, so I didn't focus too much on transitions. I enjoyed this project, and I certainly learned a lot from it."
